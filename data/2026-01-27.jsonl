Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit \"understand - plan - code\" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities."}

Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology. Comprehensive experiments on a hybrid dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the data efficiency and robustness of state-of-the-art models, including nnU-Net and U-Mamba, offering a potent strategy for high-performance medical image analysis with limited annotation budgets."}

Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures. The results achieved by the proposed method are suitable for the purpose of clinical treatment and diagnostic support of sickle cell anemia."}

Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \\textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling."}

This study presents a hybrid vision-based pipeline that integrates deep feature extraction with classical machine learning (ML) classifiers for automated construction and demolition (C\\&D) debris classification. A novel dataset comprising 1,800 balanced, high-quality images representing four material categories, Ceramic/Tile, Concrete, Trash/Waste, and Wood was collected from real construction sites in the UAE, capturing diverse real-world conditions. Deep features were extracted using a pre-trained Xception network, and multiple ML classifiers, including SVM, kNN, Bagged Trees, LDA, and Logistic Regression, were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrate that hybrid pipelines using Xception features with simple classifiers such as Linear SVM, kNN, and Bagged Trees achieve state-of-the-art performance, with up to 99.5\\% accuracy and macro-F1 scores, surpassing more complex or end-to-end deep learning approaches. The analysis highlights the operational benefits of this approach for robust, field-deployable debris identification and provides pathways for future integration with robotics and onsite automation systems."}

While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for mangrove detection, its progress is hindered by the limitations of existing datasets. In particular, many resources provide only annual map products without curated single-date image-mask pairs, limited to specific regions rather than global coverage, or remain inaccessible to the public. To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings. We also provide a benchmark across diverse semantic segmentation architectures under a country-disjoint split, establishing a foundation for scalable and reliable global mangrove monitoring."}

We analyze historical text images using a layout analysis model to extract text lines, which are then processed by an OCR model to generate a fully digitized page. We showed that our pipeline facilitates the processing of the page and produces an efficient result. We evaluated our approach on multiple datasets and demonstrate that the masked autoencoder effectively processes different types of text, including handwritten, printed and multi-language."}

However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%. These results offer preliminary insights into the viability of multimodal fusion for sign language recognition and highlight areas for further optimization and dataset expansion."}

However, in existing designs, tight coupling between \"membership matrix\" and \"subspace matrix U\" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the \"membership matrix\" and \"subspaces U\" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Compared with vanilla Transformer architectures, DMST exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency and interpretability."}
