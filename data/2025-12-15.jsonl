The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic."}

Unlike prior works that typically rely on isolated, task-specific expert models, this work aims to propose a unified model to handle diverse soccer visual understanding tasks, ranging from fine-grained perception (e.g., athlete detection) to semantic reasoning (e.g., event classification). Specifically, our contributions are threefold: (i) we present SoccerMaster, the first soccer-specific vision foundation model that unifies diverse understanding tasks within a single framework via supervised multi-task pretraining; (ii) we develop an automated data curation pipeline to generate scalable spatial annotations, and integrate them with various existing soccer video datasets to construct SoccerFactory, a comprehensive pretraining data resource; and (iii) we conduct extensive evaluations demonstrating that SoccerMaster consistently outperforms task-specific expert models across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its breadth and superiority. The data, code, and model will be publicly available."}

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. By leveraging a teacher-student framework with ResNet50 architecture, the proposed method trained on TBX11k dataset achieve impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. Experimental results further reveal that the student model consistently outperforms the teacher, underscoring improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings."}

Full paper under review for MIDL 2026 (Medical Imaging with Deep Learning)", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data."}

They often violate physical and logical rules, lack interactivity, and operate as opaque black boxes ill-suited for building structured, queryable worlds. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new paradigm focused on distilling an image caption pair into a tractable, abstract representation optimized for simulation. We introduce VDAWorld, a framework where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) acts as an intelligent agent to orchestrate this process. The VLM autonomously constructs a grounded (2D or 3D) scene representation by selecting from a suite of vision tools, and accordingly chooses a compatible physics simulator (e.g., rigid body, fluid) to act upon it. VDAWorld can then infer latent dynamics from the static scene to predict plausible future states. Our experiments show that this combination of intelligent abstraction and adaptive simulation results in a versatile world model capable of producing high quality simulations across a wide range of dynamic scenarios."}

From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have."}

Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring."}

In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency."}

Viswanath"], "title": "Information-driven Fusion of Pathology Foundation Models for Enhanced Disease Characterization", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "29 Pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks."}

Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks."}
