However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation."}
