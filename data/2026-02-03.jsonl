However, accurately interpreting unconstrained STEM student handwritten solutions with intertwined mathematical formulas, diagrams, and textual reasoning poses a significant challenge due to the lack of authentic and domain-specific benchmarks. Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions."}

While simulation platforms provide a promising alternative, existing approaches often suffer from a substantial visual and physical gap to real environments and rely on expensive sensors, precise robot calibration, or depth measurements, limiting their practicality at scale. We present Simulate Anything, a graphics-driven world modeling and simulation framework that enables efficient generation of high-fidelity embodied training data using only multi-view environment videos and off-the-shelf assets. Our approach reconstructs real-world environments into a photorealistic scene representation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), seamlessly capturing fine-grained geometry and appearance from video. We then leverage generative models to recover a physically realistic representation and integrate it into a simulation environment via a precision calibration target, enabling accurate scale alignment between the reconstructed scene and the real world. Together, these components provide a unified, editable, and physically grounded world model. Vision Language Action (VLA) models trained on our simulated data achieve strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, matching or even surpassing results obtained with real-world data, highlighting the potential of reconstruction-driven world modeling for scalable and practical embodied intelligence training."}

Ablations show that sufficiency-aware reranking and reasoning steps are complementary, helping the model both choose the right images and use them well.

A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy."}

The dataset bridges the gap between simple 2D datasets like VLMCountBench and often ambiguous real-life datasets like TallyQA, which lack control over occlusions and spatial composition. Experiments show that our dataset helps to improve generalization for out-of-distribution images, since a finetune of Qwen VL 2.5 7B on SITUATE improves accuracy on the Pixmo count test data, but not vice versa. We cross validate this by comparing the model performance across established other counting benchmarks and against an equally sized fine-tuning set derived from Pixmo count."}

However, ensuring robust performance across diverse environmental and procedural conditions remains a critical challenge. This paper investigates the impact of low-light conditions and automated image acquisition on the robustness of commercial PAD systems using a scenario test of RIV. Our results show that PAD systems experience a significant decline in performance when utilized in low-light or auto-capture scenarios, with a model-predicted increase in error rates by a factor of about four under low-light conditions and a doubling of those odds under auto-capture workflows. Specifically, only one of the tested systems was robust to these perturbations, maintaining a maximum bona fide presentation classification error rate below 3% across all scenarios. Our findings emphasize the importance of testing across diverse environments to ensure robust and reliable PAD performance in real-world applications."}

Recent vision-language and multimodal models further extend these capabilities by incorporating auxiliary information, including captions, question and answer pairs, and metadata, which broadens applications beyond conventional computer vision tasks. However, these models are typically optimized for semantic alignment between visual and textual content rather than geospatial understanding, and therefore are not suited for representing or reasoning with structured geospatial layers. In this study, we propose a novel model that enhances remote sensing imagery processing with guidance from auxiliary geospatial information. Our approach introduces a geospatial embedding mechanism that transforms diverse geospatial data into embedding patches that are spatially aligned with image patches. To facilitate cross-modal interaction, we design a guided attention module that dynamically integrates multimodal information by computing attention weights based on correlations with auxiliary data, thereby directing the model toward the most relevant regions. In addition, the module assigns distinct roles to individual attention heads, allowing the model to capture complementary aspects of the guidance information and improving the interpretability of its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing pretrained geospatial foundation models in predicting disease prevalence, highlighting its effectiveness in multimodal geospatial understanding."}

This study investigated the relationship between space allowance and play behaviour in 60 group-housed dairy calves across 14 commercial farms in the Netherlands (space range: 2.66-17.98 m2 per calf), and developed an automated computer vision pipeline for scalable monitoring. Video observations were analyzed using a detailed ethogram, with play expressed as percentage of observation period (%OP). Statistical analysis employed linear mixed models with farm as a random effect. A computer vision pipeline was trained on manual annotations from 108 hours on 6 farms and validated on held-out test data. The computer vision classifier achieved 97.6% accuracy with 99.4% recall for active play detection. Calves spent on average 1.0% of OP playing reflecting around 10 minutes per 17-hour period. The space-play relationship was non-linear, with highest play levels at 8-10 m2 per calf (1.6% OP) and lowest at 6-8 m2 and 12-14 m2 (<0.6% OP). Space remained significant after controlling for age, health, and group size. In summary, these findings suggest that 8-10 m2 per calf represents a practical target balancing welfare benefits with economic feasibility, and demonstrate that automated monitoring can scale small annotation projects to continuous welfare assessment systems."}

This paper presents an AI-enabled burn assessment and management platform that integrates multi-view photogrammetry, 3D surface reconstruction, and deep learning-based segmentation within a structured clinical workflow. Using standard multi-angle images from consumer-grade cameras, the system reconstructs patient-specific 3D burn surfaces and maps burn regions onto anatomy to compute objective metrics in real-world units, including surface area, TBSA, depth-related geometric proxies, and volumetric change. Successive reconstructions are spatially aligned to quantify healing progression over time, enabling objective tracking of wound contraction and depth reduction. The platform also supports structured patient intake, guided image capture, 3D analysis and visualization, treatment recommendations, and automated report generation. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates stable reconstructions, consistent metric computation, and clinically plausible longitudinal trends, supporting a scalable, non-invasive approach to objective, geometry-aware burn assessment and decision support in acute and outpatient care."}
