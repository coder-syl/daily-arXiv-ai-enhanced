Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines. In addition, UI-Venus-1.5 demonstrates robust navigation capabilities across a variety of Chinese mobile apps, effectively executing user instructions in real-world scenarios.

We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows."}

Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding."}

Accepted for publication at the 2026 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)", "summary": "The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.\n  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media."}

Although screening effectively reduces incidence, a notable portion of patients initially diagnosed with low-grade adenomatous polyps will still develop CRC later in life, even without the presence of known high-risk syndromes. Identifying which low-risk patients are at higher risk of progression is a critical unmet need for tailored surveillance and preventative therapeutic strategies. Traditional histological assessment of adenomas, while fundamental, may not fully capture subtle architectural or cytological features indicative of malignant potential. Advancements in digital pathology and machine learning provide an opportunity to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and objectively. This study investigates whether machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can detect subtle histological features in WSIs of low-grade tubular adenomas that are predictive of a patient's long-term risk of developing colorectal cancer."}

Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization. This enables the model to maintain text-image alignment while supporting lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis."}

We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems."}

A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment."}

However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities."}

Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing."}
