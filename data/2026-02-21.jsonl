Spencer"], "title": "Three-dimensional Damage Visualization of Civil Structures via Gaussian Splatting-enabled Digital Twins", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advancements in civil infrastructure inspections underscore the need for precise three-dimensional (3D) damage visualization on digital twins, transcending traditional 2D image-based damage identifications. Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins."}

In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations and reinforcement-based alignment in advancing video quality assessment."}

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines."}

Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning."}

We introduce a three-stage training pipeline that combines self-supervised MAE, semi-supervised hashtag classification, and CLIP-style contrastive learning to jointly optimize image and video modalities. Our architecture builds on a Vision Transformer backbone enhanced with efficient token reorganization (EViT) for improved computational efficiency.

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows."}

This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\\times$ and $3.2\\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence."}

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."}

We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting."}
