Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives.

We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution.

In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas.

Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\\ low vs.\\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\\%/19.8\\%/39.2\\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind.

Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem.

Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset.

Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a \"posts -> user vector -> labels\" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection.

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics.

To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics.

This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is \"Fast by Algorithm\", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4).

We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations.

Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result.

Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise.

Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy.

Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\\%$ with $\\sim 75\\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step.

Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis.

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view.

This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting.

To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT.

To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move.

This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization.

However, its inherent strong nonlinearity often results in convergence toward local minima. Recently, deep image prior-based reparameterized FWI (DIP-FWI) has been proposed to alleviate the dependence on massive training data. By exploiting the spectral bias and implicit regularization in the neural network architecture, DIP-FWI can effectively avoid local minima and reconstruct more geologically plausible velocity models. Nevertheless, existing DIP-FWI typically use a fixed random input throughout the inversion process, which fails to utilize the mapping and correlation between the input and output of the network. Moreover, under complex geological conditions, the lack of informative prior in the input can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, leading to artifacts and unstable reconstructions. To address these limitations, we propose a self-reinforced DIP-FWI (SRDIP-FWI) framework, in which a steering algorithm alternately updates both the network parameters and the input at each iteration using feedback from the current network output. This design allows adaptive structural enhancement and improved regularization, thereby effectively mitigating the ill-posedness in FWI. Additionally, we analyze the spectral bias of the network in SRDIP-FWI and quantify its role in multiscale velocity model building. Synthetic tests and field land data application demonstrate that SRDIP-FWI achieves superior resolution, improved accuracy and greater depth penetration compared to multiscale FWI. More importantly, SRDIP-FWI eliminates the need for manual frequency-band selection and time-window picking, substantially simplifying the inversion workflow.

Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%.

Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to \"hallucinated\" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8.

It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations.

In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching.

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG.

Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%).

In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains.

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy.

Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation.

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs.

Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work.

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure.

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem.

However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms.

We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene.

Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u201c\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e3b\u5bfc\u201d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5e8f\u5217\u53ea\u9700\u5c40\u90e8\u524d\u7f00\u5373\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u6807DaMCL\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u590d\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff08MCL\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807DaMCL\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9700\u6c42\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u57281\u20137k\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c75\u201380%\u4ec5\u9700\u6700\u8fd196\u4e2atoken\u5373\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff1bDaMCL\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u533a\u5206\u957f\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9700\u6c42\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7DaMCL\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173token\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration.

Prior work typically optimizes task- or model-specific triggers, making results difficult to compare and limiting transferability. We study universal adversarial suffixes: short token sequences (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, broadly reduce accuracy across tasks and models. Our approach learns the suffix in a differentiable \"soft\" form using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and then discretizes it for inference. Training maximizes calibrated cross-entropy on the label region while masking gold tokens to prevent trivial leakage, with entropy regularization to avoid collapse. A single suffix trained on one model transfers effectively to others, consistently lowering both accuracy and calibrated confidence.

Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite remote sensing imagery allow for near real-time monitoring. This paper uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to show that fire damage in armed conflicts can be monitored with minimal delay.

Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u5256\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5c42\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u9650\u5236\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u548c\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7259\u79d1\u5168\u666fX\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f31\u4e14\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u9650\u5236\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\uff08\u4f7f\u7528FiLM\u6839\u636e\u7236\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u5b50\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u542b\u6bcf\u5c42\u52a0\u6743Dice\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u53ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9879\uff09\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7236\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684TL-pano\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08194\u5f20\u5e26\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5168\u666f\u7259\u7247\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eUNet\u548cHRNet\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u57285\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347IoU\u3001Dice\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u89e3\u5256\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4f34\u968f\u5047\u9633\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u5256\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7259\u79d1\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias.

Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words.

Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning.

(English translation assisted by GPT)", "summary": "Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u5f15\u5bfc\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u7406\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728Kanana-1.5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b087.0046%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u7ea63.89%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u533f\u540d\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u5e38\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u8a00\u8bed\u8650\u5f85\u751a\u81f3\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u8425\u9020\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u6d41\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Kanana-1.5\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe87.0046%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u7ea63.89%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses. Additionally, SSplain identifies features that are consistent with domain-understandable features that clinicians consider as discriminative factors for ROP. We also show SSplain's generalization by applying it to additional publicly available datasets.

This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated.

Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA.

In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support. A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications. The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields.

This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution.

Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\\ low vs.\\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\\%/19.8\\%/39.2\\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust.

Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains.

The Satellite-based Monitoring Project of Deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES), a project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), stands out as a fundamental initiative in this effort, annually monitoring deforested areas not only in the Amazon but also in other Brazilian biomes. Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem. However, existing approaches present significant limitations: models evaluated in the literature still show unsatisfactory effectiveness, many do not incorporate modern architectures, such as those based on self-attention mechanisms, and there is a lack of methodological standardization that allows direct comparisons between different studies. In this work, we address these gaps by evaluating various change detection models in a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and networks incorporating self-attention mechanisms based on Transformers. We investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques, such as filtering deforested areas predicted by the models based on the size of connected components, texture replacement, and image enhancements; we demonstrate that such approaches can significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Additionally, we test different strategies for combining the evaluated models to achieve results superior to those obtained individually, reaching an F1-score of 80.41%, a value comparable to other recent works in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8F1-score\u8fbe\u523080.41%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8ePRODES\u6570\u636e\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u4ee3\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u8fde\u901a\u533a\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u9884/\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u540e\u8fbe\u523080.41%\u7684F1-score\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671f\u6587\u732e\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u5148\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

The dataset comprises 3,200 essays from HABE, each annotated by expert evaluators with criterion specific scores covering correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment enriched with detailed feedback and error examples. We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models.

Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u592e-\u5468\u8fb9\u89c6\u89c9\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6CVP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u4eb2\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u548c\u5f02\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u5468\u8fb9\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u4e91\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5750\u6807\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u4eb2\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\uff08target-affinity token\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u89c9\uff1b2\uff09\u5f02\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u683c\uff08allocentric grid\uff09\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5468\u8fb9\u89c6\u89c9\u3002", "result": "CVP\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684CVP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u592e\u4e0e\u5468\u8fb9\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u67423D\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments.

Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores.

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e8669\u4e2a\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u771f\u503c\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u503c\u7684\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f3069\u4e2a\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u5c04\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ca\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eDNN\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5171\u540c\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u6b63\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5fc5\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a \"posts -> user vector -> labels\" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements (15.41% on Kaggle dataset).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faROME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u56de\u7b54\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u95ee\u5377\u5f0f\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u6784\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "ROME\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u95ee\u5377\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u95ee\u5377\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5e16\u5b50\u4e0e\u95ee\u5377\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u4ee5\u95ee\u7b54\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cROME\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe15.41%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u95ee\u5377\u5f0f\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0cROME\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization.

In these settings, inference must run directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes built around microcontrollers (MCUs), yet most Animal Re-ID models are designed for workstations or servers and are too large for devices with small memory and low-resolution inputs. We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version.

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRAGLens\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u8bc6\u522bRAG\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8c03\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u8026\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u52a0\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668RAGLens\u3002", "result": "RAGLens\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u540e\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity. We further enhance visual quality through hierarchical feature fusion, incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors extracted from parametric SMPL models to simultaneously improve global coherence and local detail accuracy.

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faThreadWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u76f8\u6bd4\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "ThreadWeaver\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e26\u5e76\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684CoT\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8etrie\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u73b0\u6210\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6216KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff1b3\uff09\u5e76\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-8B\u7684ThreadWeaver\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe71.9%\uff08AIME24\u8fbe79.9%\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u9876\u5c16\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728token\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.53\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ThreadWeaver\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMixLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165token\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002\u5728LinkedIn\u771f\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534710\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u67650.47%\u7684\u65e5\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u586b\u5145\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMixLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u201d\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u8f93\u5165\uff1a\u5c06\u5546\u54c1\u76ee\u5f55\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7269\u54c1\u9884\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5c11\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165token\u5e76\u7f13\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165token\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5e45\u538b\u7f29\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728LinkedIn\u771f\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cMixLM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b010\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5168\u91cf\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e26\u67650.47%\u7684DAU\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "MixLM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6392\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165token\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Urban science therefore faces a fundamental challenge: converting vast, fragmented and interdisciplinary information into coherent explanations of how cities function and evolve. The emergence of AI scientists, i.e., agents capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis formation and data-driven experimentation, offers a new pathway toward accelerating this transformation, yet general-purpose systems fall short of the domain knowledge and methodological depth required for urban science research. Here we introduce a knowledge-driven AI Urban Scientist, built from hypotheses, peer-review signals, datasets and analytical patterns distilled from thousands of high-quality studies, and implemented as a coordinated multi-agent framework for end-to-end inquiry. The system generates structured hypotheses, retrieves and harmonizes heterogeneous datasets, conducts automated empirical analysis and simulation, and synthesizes insights in forms compatible with urban scientific reasoning. By providing reusable analytical tools and supporting community-driven extensions, the AI Urban Scientist lowers barriers to advanced urban analytics and acts not merely as an assistant but as an active collaborator in revealing the mechanisms that shape urban systems and in guiding the design of more resilient and equitable cities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AI\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7cfb\u7edf\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u662f\u590d\u6742\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u5398\u6e05\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u6570\u5343\u7bc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u70bc\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u5408\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u6790\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u63ed\u793a\u57ce\u5e02\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AI\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u57ce\u5e02\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u57ce\u5e02\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f19\u4f34\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup.

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001F1\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6b63\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6216\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u2014\u2014\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08Balanced Accuracy\uff09\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\uff08judge\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982LLM-as-a-judge\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\uff09\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Accuracy\u3001Precision\u3001F1\uff09\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6b63\u7c7b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9009\u51fa\u626d\u66f2\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bf4\u660eYouden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51faBalanced Accuracy\u662fJ\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u8bba\u8bc1\u3001\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Balanced Accuracy\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u7528Balanced Accuracy\uff08\u6216Youden's J\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002"}}

RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528RGB-D\u70b9\u4e91\u8fdb\u884cPCA-based\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u5c06\u8be5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0eMarigold-DC\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYU Depth v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels.

This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is \"Fast by Algorithm\", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio.

Industrial standards, in particular, contain extensive technical information and complex rules presented in highly structured formats that combine tables, scopes of application, constraints, exceptions, and numerical calculations, making KG construction especially challenging. In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches.

Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation.

We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality.

However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\\% accuracy and 60.00\\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08QHP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u578b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ece\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5176\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5411\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u7279\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQuery-aware Hub Prototype\uff08QHP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09Hub Prototype Generation\uff08HPG\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u70b9\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9891\u7e41\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u539f\u578b\uff1b2\uff09Prototype Distribution Optimization\uff08PDO\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7eaf\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u826f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u539f\u578b\u62c9\u8fd1\u5bf9\u5e94\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u578b\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728S3DIS\u548cScanNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQHP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684QHP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u578b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget.

Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling.

Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result.

Still, it remains challenging due to factors such as mechanical vibrations and cumulative sensor drift in dynamic environments. This paper presents RLCNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep learning framework for the simultaneous online calibration of these multimodal sensors. Validated on real-world datasets, RLCNet is designed for practical deployment and demonstrates robust performance under diverse conditions. To support real-time operation, an online calibration framework is introduced that incorporates a weighted moving average and outlier rejection, enabling dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters with reduced prediction noise and improved resilience to drift. An ablation study highlights the significance of architectural choices, while comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRLCNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLiDAR\u3001RADAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8054\u5408\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08LiDAR\u3001RADAR\u3001\u76f8\u673a\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u52a8\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6f02\u79fb\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRLCNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u6743\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5254\u9664\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cRLCNet\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RLCNet\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u7ebf\u6807\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEgoX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5916\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\uff09\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\uff09\u89c6\u9891\u5177\u6709\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5267\u70c8\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u53e0\u6781\u5c11\uff0c\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "EgoX\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u5fc3\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoX\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u5916\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

To address this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, a video-derived large-scale corpus with 2.5M samples and 4.35M images for subject-driven generation and manipulation. The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips. (ii) Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing. We utilize vision-language model (VLM)-based category consensus, local grounding, and diversity-aware pairing to select image pairs. (iii) Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis. We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion.

At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation.

Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts.

Their precise identification enables advanced diagnostics, facilitates personalized treatment strategies, and supports more effective monitoring of treatment progress in clinical dentistry. However, several significant challenges may arise due to the intricate geometry of individual teeth and the substantial variations observed across different individuals. To address these complexities, the development of advanced techniques, especially through the application of deep learning, is essential for the precise and reliable detection of 3D tooth landmarks. In this context, the 3DTeethLand challenge was held in collaboration with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2024, calling for algorithms focused on teeth landmark detection from intraoral 3D scans. This challenge introduced the first publicly available dataset for 3D teeth landmark detection, offering a valuable resource to assess the state-of-the-art methods in this task and encourage the community to provide methodological contributions towards the resolution of their problem with significant clinical implications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e862024\u5e74MICCAI\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e3e\u529e\u76843DTeethLand\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76843D\u7259\u9f7f\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u76843D\u7259\u9f7f\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7259\u9f7f\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u7578\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u7259\u9f7f\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ec4\u7ec73DTeethLand\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u76843D\u7259\u9f7f\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u793e\u533a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e3D\u7259\u9f7f\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "3DTeethLand\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e3a3D\u7259\u9f7f\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGeoDiffMM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f4d\u79fb\u6781\u5c0f\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u5149\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5fae\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653e\u5927\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoDiffMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u5149\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoDiffMM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoDiffMM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6297\u566a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u3002"}}

For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model.

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable.

Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling.

This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a HybridSplat \u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u70d8\u7119\u9ad8\u65af\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5149\u6805\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6cfc\u6e85\uff08HybridSplat\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u53cd\u5c04\u70d8\u7119\u9ad8\u65af\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\u70d8\u7119\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5143\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u74e6\u7247\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8fdb\u884c\u6e32\u67d3\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u53cd\u5c04\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5143\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5143\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7ea7\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5bf9\u53cd\u5c04\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u526a\u679d\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ref-NeRF\u548cNeRF-Casting\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\uff0cHybridSplat\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea67\u500d\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HybridSplat\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6807\u6746\u3002"}}

However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTrackingWorld\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u5355\u76ee3D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee3D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f2D\u8f68\u8ff9\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c62D\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5e27\u5e76\u53bb\u9664\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c2D\u8f68\u8ff9\u76843D\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c62D\u8f68\u8ff9\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5bc6\u96c6\u76843D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "TrackingWorld\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u5bc6\u96c63D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u540e\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684LayerNorm\u5c42\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u666e\u904d\u91c7\u7528Pre-Norm\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8303\u6570\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6587\u672ctoken\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u8303\u6570\u5931\u8861\u5f15\u53d1\u201c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u540e\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684LayerNorm\u5c42\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684\u8303\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-1.5\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41MLLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728MMLU\u7b49\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8303\u6570\u5931\u8861\u662fMLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89e3\u51b3\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy.

With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species. We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-Body4D achieves improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos, without any retraining.

Preprint version", "summary": "Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored.

Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings.

This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8db3\u7403\u7403\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM\u3001CSRT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u8863\u989c\u8272\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u3001\u7403\u5458\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SAM\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CSRT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eHSV\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7684\u7403\u8863\u989c\u8272\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u961f\u4f0d\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52307.6\u20137.7 FPS\u548c\u7ea61880 MB\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff1b\u8f7b\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u533a\u57df\uff085\u4eba\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u8fbe90%\uff1b\u91cd\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u6062\u590d\u7387\u4e3a50%\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6846\u540e\u91cd\u6355\u83b7\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec58.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7403\u5458\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6846\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods.

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, \"click-to-run\" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks.

Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity.

We introduce \\textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations.

Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings.

However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\\%$ with $\\sim 75\\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency.

A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms.

In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency. Fast-ARDiff achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across diverse models: on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, TransDiff attains 4.3$\\times$ lossless speedup, and NextStep-1 achieves 3$\\times$ acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step.

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSSCATeR\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6563\u5c04\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u53ca\u5e27\u95f4\u70b9\u4e91\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5c06\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c116.61\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5728\u5904\u7406LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u65f6\u4ecd\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u53d8\u5316\u533a\u57df\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u5e27\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0e\u77ed\u6b65\u957f\u6355\u6349\u70b9\u4e91\u5e27\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u7ed3\u679c\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u6563\u5c04\u5377\u79ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u5f62\u6210SSCATeR\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476.61\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SSCATeR\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65483D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern.

Brown"], "title": "Modular Neural Image Signal Processing", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents a modular neural image signal processing (ISP) framework that processes raw inputs and renders high-quality display-referred images. Unlike prior neural ISP designs, our method introduces a high degree of modularity, providing full control over multiple intermediate stages of the rendering process.~This modular design not only achieves high rendering accuracy but also improves scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles. To demonstrate the advantages of this design, we built a user-interactive photo-editing tool that leverages our neural ISP to support diverse editing operations and picture styles.

Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation.

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing.

Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance.

From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model.

This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts.

Matias Di Martino", "Guillermo Sapiro"], "title": "Chain-of-Image Generation: Toward Monitorable and Controllable Image Generation", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "19 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a \"black box.\" This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models.

However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions.

This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains.

While injecting discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment has proven effective, this approach still faces key limitations: the reliance on external, pre-trained encoders introduces overhead and domain shift. A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently.

However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch \\textbf{C}enter-\\textbf{S}urrounding \\textbf{Con}trast (CSCon) framework. Specifically, we apply masking to the center and surrounding parts separately, constructing dual-branch inputs with center-biased and surrounding-biased representations to better capture rich geometric information. Meanwhile, we introduce a patch-level contrastive loss to further enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity.

We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect. This work offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights the requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice.

However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches.

While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage.

Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

However, developing accurate detection and segmentation models requires large, precisely annotated datasets that are costly to produce. Synthetic data provides a scalable alternative, yet often lacks sufficient realism to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel workflow that integrates 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms. This approach preserves full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations while achieving photorealism without the need for specialized computer graphics expertise. We release two synthetic datasets (each containing 6,000 images depicting over 250k mushroom instances) and evaluate Mask R-CNN models trained on them in a zero-shot setting. When tested on two independent real-world datasets (including a newly collected benchmark), our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K), despite using only synthetic training data.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions.

Code and data available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/Wan-Move", "summary": "We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality.

While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction.

Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMatteViT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u4eae\u5ea6\u9634\u5f71\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u6587\u6863\u9634\u5f71\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OCR\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u6863\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u4f1a\u906e\u6321\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u6587\u672c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7b49\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982OCR\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9634\u5f71\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatteViT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9ad8\u9891\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff08HFAM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eae\u5ea6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u9634\u5f71\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u7531\u81ea\u5efa\u906e\u7f69\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728RDD\u548cKligler\u7b49\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53bb\u9634\u5f71\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728OCR\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MatteViT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6587\u6863\u9634\u5f71\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincar\u00e9 ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power.

However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention.

Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u53ea\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7684\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff09\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff09\u548c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u65bd\u52a0\u6240\u9700\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5177\u5907\u5408\u9002\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u53cd\u6f14\uff08\u5982\u68af\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u505a\u5230\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues.

Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.\n  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\\(\\times\\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\\(\\times\\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline.

Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UniLayDiff\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u5143\u7d20\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6216\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u80cc\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5404\u7c7b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniLayDiff\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5230\u5404\u7c7b\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLayDiff\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control.

While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for general image restoration, they often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the absence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that integrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an iterative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine-grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations.

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process.

However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement.

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

While sparsity has been well-exploited to scale solvers, a complementary and underexploited structure is \\emph{separability} -- where some variables (e.g., visual landmarks) appear linearly in the residuals and, for any estimate of the remaining variables (e.g., poses), have a closed-form solution. Variable projection (VarPro) methods are a family of techniques that exploit this structure by analytically eliminating the linear variables and presenting a reduced problem in the remaining variables that has favorable properties. However, VarPro has seen limited use in robotic perception; a major challenge arises from gauge symmetries (e.g., cost invariance to global shifts and rotations), which are common in perception and induce specific computational challenges in standard VarPro approaches. We present a VarPro scheme designed for problems with gauge symmetries that jointly exploits separability and sparsity. Our method can be applied as a one-time preprocessing step to construct a \\emph{matrix-free Schur complement operator}. This operator allows efficient evaluation of costs, gradients, and Hessian-vector products of the reduced problem and readily integrates with standard iterative NLS solvers. We provide precise conditions under which our method applies, and describe extensions when these conditions are only partially met.

Existing approaches often suffer from either the sim-to-real gap during policy transfer or a limited amount of training data with action labels. To address this problem, we introduce Vision-Language Distance (VLD) learning, a scalable framework for goal-conditioned navigation that decouples perception learning from policy learning. Instead of relying on raw sensory inputs during policy training, we first train a self-supervised distance-to-goal predictor on internet-scale video data. This predictor generalizes across both image- and text-based goals, providing a distance signal that can be minimized by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The RL policy can be trained entirely in simulation using privileged geometric distance signals, with injected noise to mimic the uncertainty of the trained distance predictor. At deployment, the policy consumes VLD predictions, inheriting semantic goal information-\"where to go\"-from large-scale visual training while retaining the robust low-level navigation behaviors learned in simulation. We propose using ordinal consistency to assess distance functions directly and demonstrate that VLD outperforms prior temporal distance approaches, such as ViNT and VIP.

A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance.

While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning.

It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications.

From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \\emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \\emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \\emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \\textbf{2.4$\\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space.

Our approach eliminates the need for an initial transform and remains robust even with large positional and rotational LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters. We employ the Gluestick pipeline to establish 2D-3D point and line feature correspondences for a robust and automatic initial guess. To enhance accuracy, we quantitatively analyze the impact of feature distribution on calibration results and adaptively weight the cost of each feature based on these metrics. As a result, extrinsic parameters are optimized by filtering out the adverse effects of inferior features.

While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks for safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a plug-and-play and lightweight post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone encoder, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. Hence, it scales to images of varying fields-of-view. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 1,916 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC > 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC > 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches.

However, its inherent strong nonlinearity often results in convergence toward local minima. Recently, deep image prior-based reparameterized FWI (DIP-FWI) has been proposed to alleviate the dependence on massive training data. By exploiting the spectral bias and implicit regularization in the neural network architecture, DIP-FWI can effectively avoid local minima and reconstruct more geologically plausible velocity models. Nevertheless, existing DIP-FWI typically use a fixed random input throughout the inversion process, which fails to utilize the mapping and correlation between the input and output of the network. Moreover, under complex geological conditions, the lack of informative prior in the input can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, leading to artifacts and unstable reconstructions. To address these limitations, we propose a self-reinforced DIP-FWI (SRDIP-FWI) framework, in which a steering algorithm alternately updates both the network parameters and the input at each iteration using feedback from the current network output. This design allows adaptive structural enhancement and improved regularization, thereby effectively mitigating the ill-posedness in FWI. Additionally, we analyze the spectral bias of the network in SRDIP-FWI and quantify its role in multiscale velocity model building. Synthetic tests and field land data application demonstrate that SRDIP-FWI achieves superior resolution, improved accuracy and greater depth penetration compared to multiscale FWI. More importantly, SRDIP-FWI eliminates the need for manual frequency-band selection and time-window picking, substantially simplifying the inversion workflow. Overall, the proposed method provides a novel, adaptive and robust framework for accurate subsurface velocity model reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5148\u9a8c\u5168\u6ce2\u5f62\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SRDIP-FWI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u51fa\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u6f14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a7f\u900f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7701\u53bb\u4eba\u5de5\u9891\u5e26\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u7e41\u7410\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DIP-FWI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\u75c5\u6001\u3001\u4ea7\u751f\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e14\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRDIP-FWI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u66f4\u65b0\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u7f6e\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u901f\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9646\u5730\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSRDIP-FWI\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6FWI\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a7f\u900f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9009\u53d6\u9891\u7387\u5e26\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u3002", "conclusion": "SRDIP-FWI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5730\u4e0b\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86FWI\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Code available at: https://github.com/alisakour/Conditional-NCA-Digits", "summary": "Biological systems exhibit remarkable morphogenetic plasticity, where a single genome can encode various specialized cellular structures triggered by local chemical signals. In the domain of Deep Learning, Differentiable Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a paradigm to mimic this self-organization. However, existing NCA research has predominantly focused on continuous texture synthesis or single-target object recovery, leaving the challenge of class-conditional structural generation largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Neural Cellular Automata (c-NCA) architecture capable of growing distinct topological structures - specifically MNIST digits - from a single generic seed, guided solely by a spatially broadcasted class vector. Unlike traditional generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) that rely on global reception fields, our model enforces strict locality and translation equivariance. We demonstrate that by injecting a one-hot condition into the cellular perception field, a single set of local rules can learn to break symmetry and self-assemble into ten distinct geometric attractors. Experimental results show that our c-NCA achieves stable convergence, correctly forming digit topologies from a single pixel, and exhibits robustness characteristic of biological systems.

Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

After performing an evaluation in several domains, it is highly informative to compute a (weighted) mean performance and, as shown in this paper, to scrutinize what happens during this averaging. To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences.

We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding.

To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference.

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aUTIE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5c06\u8de8\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u524a\u5f31\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u6027\u522b\uff09\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u591a\u6587\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u8026\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUnified Text-Image Embedding\uff08UTIE\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528VLM\uff08\u5982CLIP\u3001OpenCLIP\u3001SigLIP\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728RFW\u548cBFW\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUTIE\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "UTIE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHSCP\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684RFFI\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHSCP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCKA\uff08Centered Kernel Alignment\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u5c42\uff1b\u518d\u5c06\u76f8\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u6297\u566a\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728UAV-M100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHSCP\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b086.39%\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u548c84.44% FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53471.49%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSCP\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information. Along with these mechanisms, RAG-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks.

Without early diagnosis, DR can lead to vision loss. Fundus photography captures the structure of the retina along with abnormalities indicative of the stage of the disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance.

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a3DID\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e09\u7ef4\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u6216\u5bf9\u5df2\u6709\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u4f53\u79ef\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3DID\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406-\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u573a\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "3DID\u5728\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u76843DID\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Existing methods are limited by transfer settings that assume homogeneous domains or heterogeneous scenarios with only co-occurring categories. When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues.

Submitted to FM 2026", "summary": "Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the high dimensionality of images and the difficulty of modeling visual environments. While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u673a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\u635f\u5931\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c06DWM\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eStar\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08StarV\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08conformal prediction\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DWM\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently.

Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN.

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLUVC\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u9891\u8c31\u526a\u679d\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6216\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u6d45\u5c42\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faLossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f74\u4e0a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\uff1b2\uff09\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u529b/\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9891\u8c31\u526a\u679d\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u526a\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u4ee3FlashAttention\uff1b3\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u76f4\u81f3\u5728LLM\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u9010\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLUVC\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u9020\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LUVC\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u4e0eLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present an approach for searching and detecting a given entity in a video sequence. Specifically, we study how the deep learning technique by artificial neuralnetworks allows us to detect a character in a video sequence. The technique of detecting a character in a video is a complex field of study, considering the multitude of objects present in the data under analysis. From the results obtained, we highlight the following, compared to state of the art: In our approach, within the field of Computer Vision, the structuring of supervised learning algorithms allowed us to achieve several successes from simple characteristics of the target character. Our results demonstrate that is new approach allows us to locate, in an efficient way, wanted individuals from a private or public image base. For the case of Angola, the classifier we propose opens the possibility of reinforcing the national security system based on the database of target individuals (disappeared, criminals, etc.) and the video sequences of the Integrated Public Security Centre (CISP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u54e5\u62c9\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7269\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5982\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u51fa\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u79c1\u6709\u6216\u516c\u5171\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u54e5\u62c9\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8e2a\u4eba\u5458\u6216\u7f6a\u72af\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We first establish the theoretical foundation by deriving a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism. This insight enables the creation of the E-Deflare Benchmark, a comprehensive resource featuring a large-scale simulated training set, E-Flare-2.7K, and the first-ever paired real-world test set, E-Flare-R, captured by our novel optical system.

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging.

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening.

This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios.

A key limitation is that models are not explicitly trained to differentiate between compositionally similar prompts and images, resulting in outputs that are close to the intended description yet deviate in fine-grained details. To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability. AgentComp achieves state-of-the-art results on compositionality benchmarks such as T2I-CompBench, without compromising image quality$-$a common drawback in prior approaches$-$and even generalizes to other capabilities not explicitly trained for, such as text rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgentComp\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728T2I-CompBench\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u7b49\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ec4\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentComp\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5177\u5907\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u548cVQA\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6784\u5efa\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5bf9\u7ec4\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728T2I-CompBench\u7b49\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u7b49\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentComp\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u727a\u7272\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects.

Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GimbalDiffusion \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\uff08\u4ee5\u91cd\u529b\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u671d\u5411\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u3001null-pitch \u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa GimbalDiffusion \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4e49\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5168\u666f360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 null-pitch conditioning \u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u5373\u53ef\u5bf9\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684 SpatialVID-HQ \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GimbalDiffusion \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to \"hallucinated\" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSuperF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08MISR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5171\u4eabINR\u548c\u5b50\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe8\u500d\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u201c\u5e7b\u89c9\u201d\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08MISR\uff09\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5b50\u50cf\u7d20\u504f\u79fb\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u5149\u5b66\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSuperF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5750\u6807\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5373\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e27\u4e4b\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u8be5INR\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u95f4\u5b50\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8d85\u91c7\u6837\u5750\u6807\u7f51\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u624b\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe8\u500d\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5e27\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eINR\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s.

This, however, comes with the lack of intuitive editability offered by traditional triangle mesh-based methods. In contrast, we propose a method that combines the accuracy and fidelity of 2D Gaussian Splatting with the intuitiveness of UV texture mapping. By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the accuracy of our reconstructions, the quality of our relighting results, and the ability to provide intuitive controls for modifying an avatar's appearance and geometry via texture mapping without additional optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54082D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\uff08Gaussian Splatting\uff09\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfUV\u7eb9\u7406\u6620\u5c04\u76f4\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6750\u8d28\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u683cUV\u7eb9\u7406\u6620\u5c04\u6240\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c4\u8303\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5143\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6a21\u677f\u7f51\u683c\u7684UV\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6807\u51c6UV\u57df\u4e0a\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u89c2/\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0eUV\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image.

Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $\u0394$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u0394-LFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Flow Matching\uff09\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u75be\u75c5\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u5355\u8c03\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u5355\u8c03\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e5f\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u4e3a\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Flow Matching\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u60a3\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u6cbf\u7279\u5b9a\u8f74\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5176\u5e45\u5ea6\u968f\u75be\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u589e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7eb5\u5411MRI\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u0394-LFM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u0394-LFM\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u75be\u75c5\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff083DVG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5View-on-Graph\uff08VoG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5916\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f2D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8bbf\u95ee\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c3DVG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a2D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u201cVLM + SI\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u6df7\u6742\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201cVLM x SI\u201d\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aView-on-Graph\uff08VoG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba9VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u6309\u9700\u83b7\u53d6\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVoG\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c3DVG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u900f\u660e\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for early CKD detection from CT kidney images, complemented by class balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and interpretability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The model was trained and evaluated on the CT KIDNEY DATASET, which contains 12,446 CT images, including 3,709 cyst, 5,077 normal, 1,377 stone, and 2,283 tumor cases.

For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning.

However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\\textbf{G}lacial \\textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{I}nstance \\textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66).

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoRel\u7684\u65b0\u578b4D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff084DGS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\uff08ARBB\uff09\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\uff08FHD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b4D\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u6216\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoRel\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\uff08ARBB\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5904\u5efa\u7acb\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u951a\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u951a\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u5e27\u95f4\u5f62\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u53cc\u5411\u5f62\u53d8\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\uff08FHD\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u6c34\u5e73\u5bf9\u951a\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b4D\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoRel\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRel\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

To facilitate a more efficient and accessible diagnostic approach for PD, we propose a dynamic facial expression analysis-based PD auxiliary diagnosis method. This method targets hypomimia, a characteristic clinical symptom of PD, by analyzing two manifestations: reduced facial expressivity and facial rigidity, thereby facilitating the diagnosis process. We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions.

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360\u00b0 scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360\u00b0 scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLoGoColor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u6d88\u96642D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8272\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u53473D\u4e0a\u8272\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8272\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u76843D\u4e0a\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e02D\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u989c\u8272\u88ab\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u5355\u8c03\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoGoColor\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5b50\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u5185\u90e8\u4e0e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u989c\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5408\u7406\u76843D\u4e0a\u8272\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Color Diversity Index\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u4e0a\u8272\u4e2d\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8272\u5f69\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks.

We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories. Our model achieves 85.61% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.8564, while providing clinically meaningful explanations that align model attention with established dermatological assessment criteria. The uncertainty quantification module decomposes prediction confidence into epistemic and aleatoric components, enabling automatic flagging of unreliable predictions for clinical review. Our results demonstrate that high classification performance can be achieved alongside comprehensive interpretability, potentially facilitating greater trust and adoption in clinical dermatology workflows.

Code available at https://github.com/SonghanWu/yolov8n-SPTS", "summary": "This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%).

These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds.

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability.

To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \\textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions.

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues.

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5RnD-Avatar\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u65b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u903c\u771f\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u65b0\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u548c3DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u8863\u7269\u8936\u76b1\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRnD-Avatar\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u59ff\u6001\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u4f53\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u8eab\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f62\u53d8\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3001\u65b0\u59ff\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u903c\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u4efb\u610f\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u53ca\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "RnD-Avatar\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e3DGS\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u5149\u7167\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

To address this challenge, we present StereoWorld, an end-to-end framework that repurposes a pretrained video generator for high-fidelity monocular-to-stereo video generation. Our framework jointly conditions the model on the monocular video input while explicitly supervising the generation with a geometry-aware regularization to ensure 3D structural fidelity. A spatio-temporal tiling scheme is further integrated to enable efficient, high-resolution synthesis. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate a high-definition stereo video dataset containing over 11M frames aligned to natural human interpupillary distance (IPD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoWorld substantially outperforms prior methods, generating stereo videos with superior visual fidelity and geometric consistency.

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods.

This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision.

Maxwell"], "title": "Log NeRF: Comparing Spaces for Learning Radiance Fields", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "comment": "The 36th British Machine Vision Conference", "summary": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728NeRF\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528log RGB\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684sRGB\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f7f\u7528sRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u53d7BIDR\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3alog RGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u96c6\u4e86\u7ea630\u6bb5GoPro\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728linear\u3001sRGB\u3001GPLog\u548clog RGB\u56db\u79cd\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u635f\u5931\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0clog RGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684NeRF\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5149\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u548cNeRF\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528log RGB\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347NeRF\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.\n  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.\n  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs.

Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling.

Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and could be seamlessly integrated into various registration methods to enhance their performance.

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes.

We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields.

As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction.

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDAPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u201c\u5b54\u6d1e\u201d\u3001\u201c\u5212\u75d5\u201d\u7b49\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7f3a\u9677\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bcf\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u65e2\u8017\u65f6\u53c8\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8c03\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u6df7\u5408\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u4e8c\u5143\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAPO\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53476.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "DAPO\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5e94\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline.

Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance.

CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface.

However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels. It can facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale feature maps and extract richer semantic information and detailed information through reasonable two-way guidance. Extensive experiments prove that GGL-Net has achieves state-of-the-art results on the public real NUAA-SIRST dataset and the public synthetic NUDT-SIRST dataset.

To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

Specifically, our proposed model comprises three main components: (1) a shallow feature extraction module, termed Spatial-Net, which performs residual learning and bilinear interpolation; (2) a low-frequency enhancement branch based on the DWT that refines coarse image structures; and (3) a shared high-frequency refinement branch that simultaneously enhances the LH (horizontal), HL (vertical), and HH (diagonal) wavelet subbands using a single CNN with shared weights. As a result, the DWT enables subband decomposition, while the inverse DWT reconstructs the final high-resolution output. By doing so, the integration of spatial- and frequency-domain learning enables DDSRNet to achieve highly competitive performance with low computational cost on three hyperspectral image datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for hyperspectral image super-resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u57df\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DDSRNet\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u9891\u57df\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u53cc\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "DDSRNet\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u7528\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7684Spatial-Net\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\uff08DWT\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7c97\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b(3) \u5171\u4eab\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3aLH\u3001HL\u548cHH\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5b50\u5e26\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DWT\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u9006DWT\u91cd\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u7ec8\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "DDSRNet\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u7684DDSRNet\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

Although graph-based methods such as GraphTunnel achieve strong accuracy, they introduce significant latency and computational overhead due to recursive parsing and graph construction, limiting their suitability for real-time deployment. This work presents DNS-HyXNet, a lightweight extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) hybrid framework designed for efficient sequence-based DNS tunnel detection. DNS-HyXNet integrates tokenized domain embeddings with normalized numerical DNS features and processes them through a two-layer xLSTM network that directly learns temporal dependencies from packet sequences, eliminating the need for graph reconstruction and enabling single-stage multi-class classification. The model was trained and evaluated on two public benchmark datasets with carefully tuned hyperparameters to ensure low memory consumption and fast inference. Across all experimental splits of the DNS-Tunnel-Datasets, DNS-HyXNet achieved up to 99.99% accuracy, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 99.96%, and demonstrated a per-sample detection latency of just 0.041 ms, confirming its scalability and real-time readiness.

However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5f31\u5316\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece14.92%\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.43%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65bd\u52a0\u4e13\u95e8\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLM\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49token\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5931\u771f\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece14.92%\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.43%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728MLLM-based IQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level.

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context.

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection.

However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.\n  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u89c2\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c6\u89d2\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u64cd\u63a7\uff08\u5982\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u91c7\u6837\u805a\u5408\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u5c42\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5916\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5916\u89c2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u5b9a\u5916\u89c2\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f3D\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7eb3\u3002"}}

Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90.

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields significant performance improvements across a wide range of MLLMs. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/casiatao/IF-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6IF-Bench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GenViP\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5404\u7c7bMLLM\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b499\u5f20\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u548c680\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684IF-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53cc\u8bed\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5224\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u5bf940\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bGenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cdMLLM\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "IF-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GenViP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7684Tip-and-Cue\u536b\u661f\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u524d\u671f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\uff08tips\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u661f\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff08cues\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AI\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5728\u6d77\u4e8b\u8239\u8236\u8ffd\u8e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u536b\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u53ca\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u529b\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3001\u591a\u661f\u534f\u540c\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89c2\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8Tip-and-Cue\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5386\u53f2\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7a7a\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\uff08tips\uff09\uff1b\u6839\u636e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff08cues\uff09\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u591a\u9897\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5904\u7406\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u62a5\u544a\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u6d1e\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d77\u4e8b\u8239\u8236\u8ffd\u8e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528AIS\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u5411\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8Tip-and-Cue\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u518d\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6d77\u4e8b\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5411\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization.

Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution.

Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.

Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \\textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity. (2) An unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) benchmark utilizing SMA's group diversity to evaluate UDA algorithms across more scenarios, offering a more comprehensive benchmark with lower error bars (reduced by 73\\% and 28\\% in closed-set setting and UniDA setting, respectively) compared to existing efforts.

Preprint version", "summary": "Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation.

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores.

Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels.

While prior work focuses on offline struggle classification and localization, real-time applications require models capable of detecting and anticipating struggle online. We reformulate struggle localization as an online detection task and further extend it to anticipation, predicting struggle moments before they occur. We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%.

Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance.

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction.

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling.

We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms.

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training.

We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.

However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information.

Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent. This framework presents itself as a decision-support tool that can be used to respond to a pandemic, screen tuberculosis, and assess thoracic disease regularly in various healthcare facilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eEfficientNetV2-M\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbCheXNet\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u77ed\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89e3\u8bfb\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5982CheXNet\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528EfficientNetV2-M\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001AdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b18,080\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u80f8\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e5d\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe96.45%\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a95.30%\uff09\uff0c\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u81f391.08%\uff1b\u5bf9COVID-19\u548c\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe99.95%\u548c99.97%\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a06.8\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1111.4%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u9ad822.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u75ab\u60c5\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u7ed3\u6838\u7b5b\u67e5\u53ca\u5e38\u89c4\u80f8\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\\pm$ 9.1%).

Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c063D\u5f62\u72b6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7531\u89e3\u6790\u56fe\u5143\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u88c5\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u56fe\u5143SuperFrustum\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u62df\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5ResFit\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u56fe\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u53c8\u7d27\u51d1\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSuperFrustum\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u6790\u56fe\u5143\uff08\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u51e0\u4e4e\u5904\u5904\u53ef\u5fae\u7b49\u7279\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u62df\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5ResFit\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u62df\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u6b8b\u5dee\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0cIoU\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc79\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c63D\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002"}}

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411Vision Transformer\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5206\u5c42\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u81f3\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u4e91\u7aef\u867d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u53ef\u4fe1\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982\u624b\u673a\u6216Jetson\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u5207\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u5206\u53d1\u81f3\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4efb\u4e00\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u805a\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ec5\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5Segment Anything Model\uff08SAM\uff09\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Research manuscript based on the final project for CS6795 (Introduction to Cognitive Science), Georgia Tech", "summary": "Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations.

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints.

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples.

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines.

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings.

To help plwMND articulate their needs about the system efficiently and effectively, we iteratively design and develop a novel multimodal text generation system called ImageTalk through a tailored proxy-user-based and an end-user-based design phase.

We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset.

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faChronusOmni\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6ChronusAV\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u8054\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7269\u8bf4\u8bdd\u65f6\u753b\u9762\u5185\u5bb9\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5355\u5143\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6233token\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u4ea4\u9519\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6ChronusAV\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "ChronusOmni\u5728ChronusAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u8d8530%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u9886\u5148\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ChronusOmni\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination.

However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506\u00b0 and a root mean squared error of 0.1957\u00b0, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs.

However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot. The dataset and code will be made publicly available for visual navigation and scene representation research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faYOPO-Nav\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5ea6\u91cf\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03YOPO-Campus\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u56fe\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\u89c6\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5ea6\u91cf\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "YOPO-Nav\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7565\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8fde\u7684\u5c40\u90e83D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f4d\u59ff\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6cbf\u6f14\u793a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd4\u56de\u3002", "result": "\u5728YOPO-Campus\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cYOPO-Nav\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u822a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "YOPO-Nav\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u89c6\u9891\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.
